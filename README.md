# es-theme-Arcade1up-5x4-Horizontal
Arcade1up RetroPie / ES Theme for 5:4 Horizontal Displays

Created by Justin Case based on code by Dwayne Hurst aka Hursty

The goal of this project is to recreate the look and feel of Arcade1up's UI

There are over 300 system icons included with this theme

Make sure you have your UI Settings set to Transition Style: Instant

I've also included a "Winners Don't Use Drugs" loading screen (_inc/launching.jpg)
